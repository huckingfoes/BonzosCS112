## BON-CS110
### Introduction to Programming and Computer Science
#### Spring 2021.  
##### [huck#0001](https://huckingfoes.xyz)


A technical introduction to the fundamentals of programming with an emphasis on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Starting from first principles, we will cover a large subset of the Python programming language, including its standard libraries and programming paradigms. This course assumes no prior programming experience. Even so, it is intended to be fast-paced and rigorous.


*I plan on having the the class help lead the projects if they feel strongly, but as of now we're going to eventually make an efficient, well thought out Discord bot by the end. To join the class and other things [join the class server](https://discord.gg/hKjYz8hvJn), go to #‚≠ê-roles.*


## Class Plans and Notes
**Overall, we had a pretty great time discussing life for a bit, diving into programming background/their interests in taking this course, and I know I found it enlightening. We then briefly went over how python deals with implicitly typed variables.**
